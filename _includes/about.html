  I’m a data science graduate student at UC San Diego with a focus on machine learning, scalable analytics, and data-driven decision making. I enjoy exploring how advanced techniques can turn raw data into meaningful insights and practical solutions. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects where I can apply and grow my skills in data science and ML while collaborating with teams to solve complex problems. Interested in connecting or working together? Feel free to reach out.

      I’ve worked with structured and unstructured datasets across domains, from court case records to large-scale system logs. My focus is on uncovering patterns through data exploration, feature engineering, and statistical modeling. 
     I enjoy transforming raw information into clear insights and building visualizations that make data both accessible and impactful.

      I believe data pipelines and machine learning models should be built to scale, not left behind in notebooks. Drawing on my experience with SQL, Python, and cloud-based tools, I’ve developed automated workflows, dashboards, and ML prototypes that deliver real value. 
     I’m especially interested in bridging data engineering and machine learning to create end-to-end solutions.

      I value collaboration and clarity in data science. 
     Through my work as a teaching assistant and data analyst, I’ve learned to explain complex technical concepts in ways that resonate with both technical and non-technical audiences. Whether through dashboards, presentations, or one-on-one discussions, I aim to make data-driven insights understandable and actionable.
